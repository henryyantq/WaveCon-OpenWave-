# WaveCon(OpenWave)
A programming system designed for analog signal processing &amp; analysis

Attention. This programme will always be in progress for some time. In the meantime, you can still apply the programme to your own work since every programme I upload is debugged for execution.

The project is based on OpenALSA (Assistive Linear System Analysis) developed by Team Forth.
